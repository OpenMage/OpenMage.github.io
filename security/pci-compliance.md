There is currently a lot of confusion as Visa and PayPal started to make pressure to get people mvoing away from Magento 1.

Please be aware, that OpenMage is an independent Project, and is not affected by this. 
But we are also not a PayPal Partner, so we get not the privileged handling from PayPal as their bigger commercial partners get.
Its probably similar for Visa.  
This means, you get the same treatment from them, as every inhouse software would get from them. This Page should help to know which additional measurements are required for this, and what you can do to stay complaiant.
