                        Magento Community is one of the few Open Source ecommerce solutions on the market, which means
                        that the code is open for anyone to use for free and apply any changes necessary. Combining it
                        with the rich out of the box features available makes it an excellent start for a complex online
                        store solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Product attribute management, complemented with customer details, topped up with the SEO tools,
                        secure payments, and complete inventory management is what makes Magento a great starter tool.
                        All the features can be further enhanced with the help of extensions - modules that are
                        installed atop of Magento to provide additional functionality.

                    <p>
                        Magento community has over 800k members around the globe, including users at forums, developers,
                        enthusiasts, and evangelists who have been with Magento since the beginning and can offer robust
                        expertise. Yearly events in different parts of the world unite development agencies, Magento
                        partners, and extension developers.

                    <p>
                        A special part of the Magento community belongs to the extension developers, which take Magento
                        store experience to the level above with performance. Extension developers made Magento
                        Marketplace possible, where store owners may find new looks for their stores, missing
                        functionality, or discover powerful marketing solutions.

                            After its End of Life, Magento 1 will not be available for the general public. Adobe will
                            remove all download links, links to the documentation and will stop releasing patches even
                            for critical bugs and security issues. That’s where OpenMage comes in, keeping Magento CE
                            healthy and up to the current standards.

                            End of Life also means that all Magento 1 extensions are removed from Magento Marketplace;
                            however extension developers will still offer them, probably with great discounts. This
                            developed infrastructure is another point towards staying with Magento CE.
