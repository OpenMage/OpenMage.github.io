## About Us

OpenMage is a Magento1 fork started in 2015 as a result of the many Bugfixes
created by the Community, which never got included into the official Magento1 releases.
With the big differences between Magento versions 1 and 2, and the high cost of migration,
the goal became to provide a long term support Version with a strong focus on staying backwards compatible to Magento 1.

With a total of 12 Maintainer, 90 contributors and over 250 Patches,
we already have a strong adventage over Magento 1.
