## Programmers

#### Participate in Pull Requests

We receive many Pull Requests and these take time to review and discuss. Join the discussion, let us know what PRs you
like and don't like, and check out the code and test it out! Your code reviews and comments will truly have an impact!

You can setup a Docker-based development environment in literally [one easy step](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/blob/1.9.4.x/dev/openmage/README.md) so you can easily checkout a PR and help test it!

#### Develop Features

Browse the [issues](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/issues) list and tackle a problem! The community will forever be grateful and you may become featured on our home page!

#### Report and Fix Bugs

If you find a bug, please report it! We stronly prefer that you start a Pull Request with your suggested fix as well; this will really speed up the process to get a fix merged.

#### Tag your compatible Modules

Add the topic "openmage" to your GitHub-hosted extensions so they will be listed on [https://github.com/topics/openmage](https://github.com/topics/openmage).

Also, add "openmage" under "keywords" in your `composer.json` file, so its listed on [https://packagist.org/search/?tags=openmage](https://packagist.org/search/?tags=openmage).

## Organization

#### RFC Process

Help us form our future, by participating in the RFC Process.

Because some changes will need Backwards Compatibility Breaks, this ones should not be decided by just 3 people, but by the majority of theCommunity. (So the RFC Process is build to slow the process down, to make it possible for a lot more people to participate)
